Text Processor Project

Unfortunately I don't remember how to run this program. When I have more time I will go back through the code.

What I remember:
This project takes in a given text, such as the book "Huckleberry Finn", and computes certain metrics such as the average word length, the longest word, the number of paragraphs, or the average sentence length. It used to write it into the index.html file, but that seems to be broken at the moment.
