Lab 4:
This week's exercise is designed to give you practice with interactive "universe" programming in Typed Racket. Unlike previous lab exercises, for this one we will supply you with a partially-complete program; your task is to complete the program and enable the specified functionality. Please read this whole document from start to finish before starting the work.

To run Racket projects:
  Launch DrRacket. Then, go to the File menu, choose Install Package, and then enter 2htdp-typed in the text box.

  Click the run button to run the code.
