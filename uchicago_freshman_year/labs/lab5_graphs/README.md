Lab 5:
This week's exercise is to build a movie-adjacency graph such that each vertex is an actor, and each edge is a movie in which the two connected actors both appeared.

Your task this week is to write code to read data from a structured text file, build the corresponding movie-adjacency graph from that data, and write that data in a format that can be understood by graphviz tools, suitable for visualization. 

To run Racket projects:
  Launch DrRacket. Then, go to the File menu, choose Install Package, and then enter 2htdp-typed in the text box.

  Click the run button to run the code.
